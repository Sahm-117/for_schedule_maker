## üìã Next Steps (In Order)

### Immediate (Run These First)
1. **Run `SUPABASE_MIGRATION.sql` in Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to Supabase ‚Üí SQL Editor
   - Paste contents of `scripts/SUPABASE_MIGRATION.sql`
   - Click Run

2. **Run Data Migration Script**
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node migrate-teams-from-descriptions.js
   ```
   - This will extract teams from existing activities
   - Creates backup automatically
   - Default teams will be created with colors

3. **Verify Migration**
   - Check Supabase tables: Team & ActivityTeam
   - Verify activities no longer have "(Team)" in descriptions
   - Confirm teams are assigned correctly

### Development (After Migration)
1. Build Team Management UI (Phase 2)
2. Add Team Selection to Activity Modals (Phase 3)
3. Display Teams in Schedule View (Phase 4)
4. Update PDF Export (Phase 5)
5. Test entire flow end-to-end
6. Deploy to production

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration Required**: Run SQL migration first
2. **Data Migration Recommended**: Run data migration to extract existing teams
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality unaffected
4. **Backward Compatible**: Activities without teams still work
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add teams to new activities gradually

---

## üí° Future Enhancements (Nice to Have)

- **Team Categories**: Group teams (e.g., "Ministry", "Support", "Leadership")
- **Team Icons**: Allow emoji or icon selection
- **Team Permissions**: Restrict certain teams to certain users
- **Team Statistics**: Show which teams are most active
- **Team Templates**: Preset team configurations
- **Team Notifications**: Alert specific teams when mentioned
- **Team Colors in Notifications**: Email/Telegram with team colors

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `scripts/backup-activities-*.json` for data backup
2. Review `TEAM_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for troubleshooting
3. Check Supabase logs for SQL errors
4. Migration script is idempotent (safe to re-run)

---

**Ready for Phase 2!** Run the migrations first, then continue with UI implementation.
